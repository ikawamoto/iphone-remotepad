RemotePad README

    This directory contains source files of RemotePad application for
    an iPhone / iPod touch.

        RemotePad is an application that controls a mouse cursor on
        your desktop PC.  You can use an iPhone or iPod touch as a
        wireless touchpad.  You can get RemotePad from the iTunes App
        Store.

    To compile this, you need a iPhone SDK(free).  And to run this on
    iPhone or iPod touch, you need a iPhone Developer Program(not
    free).

    I'm sorry to say that I don't answer the generic questions related
    to the iPhone SDK.  Please see the iPhone Dev Center resources.
