    <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><a class="question" name="port">Q: What is port number?</a>

	<p>
	  In a word, please use 5583.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Network applications need a port number to connect with others.
	  Most applications have well known numbers, but RemotePad does not.

	  So please enter '5583' for a port number.
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="ipport">Q: How can I find out IP address and port number?</a>

	<p>
	  If you use a Windows, please enter the IP address and the
	  port number that RemotePad Server displays.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you use a Mac, you don't have to enter the IP address and
	  a port number for your Mac, you could select the name of
	  your Mac in a list.

	  <a href="http://www.tenjin.org/RemotePad/picker1.png">This
	  image</a> shows a list of names which you can select.

	  (Only one Mac named 'shloeder' is found in a list of this image.)

	  In technically, iPhone/iPod touch serarches your Mac with
	  Bonjour technology, so we don't have to and could not know
	  the IP and port of Macs.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you cannot show your Mac in this list, please check the
	  WiFi connection of an iPhone/iPod touch is fine, and an
	  iPhone/iPod touch and your Mac are in the same network.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you use an UNIX like Linux, please check your network
	  configuration and find the IP address that you use.

	  The port number is 5583.
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="addressfamily">Q: What does "Address family not supported by protocol family" mean?</a>

	<p>
	  If you use a server for Mac OS X version, please check the
	  "Firewall" tab settings in the "Security" part of the
	  "System Preferences".

	  The Firewall tab shows allowing or denying connections of your Mac.
	  RemotePad Server needs one of following settings to use.

	  <ul>
	    <li>Check a "Set access for specific services and applications" option
	      and click an "Allow" button in the popup dialog window which appears
	      when you start the Server.
	      <br>
	      or,
	    <li>Check an "Allow all incoming connections" option.
	  </ul>

	  NOTE: This changes the network security behavior of your Mac.
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="timedout">Q: What does "Operation timed out" mean?</a>

	<p>
	  There are many reasons to display "Operation timed out" error.
	</p>

	<p>
	  One reason is the Windows Firewall.

	  If you enable an option "Don't allow exceptions" on a
	  General tab of the Windows Firewall, or if you disable an
	  option "Display a notification when Windows Firewall blocks
	  a program" on a Exceptions tab of the Windows Firewall,
	  please disable a option "Don't allow exceptions", and enable
	  a option "Display a notification when Windows Firewall
	  blocks a program".
	  <br>
	  NOTE: This changes a your PC's behavior of network security.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Another reason is typing an incorrect IP address and a port number.

	  IP addresses and port numbers are not familiar things for
	  everyone, please enter carefully.
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="noroute">Q: What does "No route to host" mean?</a>

	<p>
	  The error message "No route to host" means that your iPhone
	  / iPod touch does not have a network connection or route to
	  a RemotePad Server.

	  I guess two reasons for this error.

	  <ol>
	    <li> Your iPhone / iPod touch and your PC are not in a same
	      network, and your home router or your home wireless access
	      point does not allow communications between your iPhone /
	      iPod and your PC.  To solve the problem, you have to
	      change the setting of your home router or your home
	      wireless access point.

	    <li> Your iPhone / iPod touch does not connect to your
	      network.  Please be sure that your iPhone / iPod touch
	      join the correct WiFi network.
	  </ol>
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="accelerometer">Q: Why mouse cursor doesn't move when I move iPhone with enabling 'Mouse moving by Accelerometer' feature?</a>

	<p>
	  Keep tapping a touch pad area for mouse moving by
	  Accelerometer.
	</p>

      <li><a class="question" name="disconnected">Q: What does "Peer Disconnected" mean?</a>

	<p>
	  The error message "Peer Disconnected" means the network
	  connection with a server is closed or ended with some reasons.

	  This may occur when followings:
	  <ul>
	    <li> mainly, iPhone/iPod touch WiFi connection is closed, or
	    <li> the server program on your PC is terminated, or
	    <li> rarely, iPhone OS network is unstable.
	  </ul>
	</p>

    </ul>
